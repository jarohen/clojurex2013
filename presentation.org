* What to expect?

- Setting up a CLJS project
- "All Mod Cons"
- Experiences and UI Patterns
- Putting the Blocks Together!

* What do we need for a CLJS project?

- Web server (ring/http-kit)
  - Serving page frame and compiled JS
- nREPL
  - Make changes to the running web-app
- lein-cljsbuild
  - Re-compiles CLJS when the files change

* All Mod Cons - REPL

How does a CLJS REPL work?

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(loop []
  ;; Browser told to request an HTTP route
  ;; Response contains JS to execute
  ;; Browser sends result in next request, waits for next command
  (recur))
#+END_SRC
