ClojureScript: Putting the Blocks Together

This talk will be a whistlestop tour of how Clojure's younger brother
can really change the way you write code for a browser. We'll cover
getting up and running, I'll be sharing my experiences of
ClojureScript thus far (including the awesomeness that is core.async)
and apply all of the above to write a simple browser-based game.
