After graduating from Imperial College London around two years ago,
James has worked at both ends of the company-size spectrum, from a
large financial institution to a small Clojure startup. He has been
developing in Clojure commercially for 18 months and, having been a
Java developer previously, is thoroughly enjoying the breath of fresh
air!

James is the author and maintainer of a variety of open source Clojure
libraries, including Nomad (a configuration management library) and
Chime (a bare-bones scheduler). 

Unfortunately, he doesn't (yet) fight crime by night.
